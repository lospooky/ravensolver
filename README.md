# RavenSolver
RavenSolver is a fully automated solver for [Progressive Matrices Problems] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven's_Progressive_Matrices),
a widely used format of abstract reasoning test.<br>
It was developed by me and my partner Victor Ström (now Hagelbäck) as our Master's Thesis project.
