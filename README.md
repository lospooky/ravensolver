# RavenSolver
RavenSolver is a fully automated solver for [Progressive Matrices Problems] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven's_Progressive_Matrices),
a widely used format of abstract reasoning test.<br>
It was developed by me and my partner Victor Ström (now Hagelbäck) as our Master's Thesis project.<br>
In brief, it takes a Progressive Matrix as its input and it will (hopefully) generate the solution.</br>
For a thorough description of the approach we used as well as for the results we obtained on Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices
sections C-D-E, please refer to our [thesis report] (http://studentarbeten.chalmers.se/publication/123536-an-anthropomorphic-solver-for-ravens-progressive-matrices)
or to the [journal article] (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cogsys.2012.08.002) we published.
